Object Oriented Programming is a programming approach where you model data as an object.  Each object contains a list of methods and attributes that can be used on the object.  One of the major pro's of object oriented design is conde reusibility, with class inheritance a child class will inherit the parents attributes and methods.  This feature helps minimize the amount of boiler plate code in software.  With procedural paradigm, the program is designed more like the flow of logic or a flow of steps.  I think if I would try to use each in design paradign in a real world situation, OOP would be better suited for working with taxonomy which is classifying organisms on the basis of shared characteristic, and I would compare procedural programming to following the steps in a cooking recipe.
