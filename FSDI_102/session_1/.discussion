A programming language is a set of instructions that a computer will exeucute and then output the results.  Most modern programming languages consist of a high level language that is typically in a human readable format and structure.  They're many different languages that exist and that vary depending on what constraints the creator needed, for example LISP was originally created as a practical way of using symbols to write computer programs, mainly using operators.  Some languages aren't very practical but are used more of a proof of concept or to obfuscate e.g. Whitespace (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)).  Each language has it's pro's and con's whether it complexity, type system, whether or not it uses a garbage collector.  New programming languages are released all the time now, however when picking a language it's usually a good idea to find one that has a good overall community, is being contributed frequently and has a low chance of being abandoned
